Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [Month Day, Year]_

FRZR (“the App”) helps you track freezer items and, if you choose, share that information with specific people you trust.
This policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and the choices you have.

1. Information We Collect
- Freezer Inventory Data: The items you add, update, or remove (names, quantities, dates, notes).
- Known Apple IDs: The Apple IDs you explicitly add for sharing your freezer list.
- Device & Diagnostics: Device model, iOS version, and crash analytics to improve stability.

2. How We Use Your Information
- Core Functionality: To store and sync your freezer inventory across your devices using iCloud.
- Optional Sharing: To share your inventory only with the Apple IDs you designate. No data is shared automatically or publicly.

3. Data Storage & Security
- All freezer data is stored in your private iCloud account using Apple’s end-to-end encryption.
- We never see or store your iCloud password.
- All communications with iCloud use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS).

4. Third-Party Services
- Apple iCloud provides the cloud storage and sharing mechanism. Apple’s own privacy policy governs their service.
- We do not sell, rent, or otherwise monetize your personal information.

5. Your Choices & Rights
- Control Sharing: Add or remove known Apple IDs at any time in the App.
- Delete Data: Deleting the App or removing your iCloud data will delete your freezer inventory and any shared copies.
- Access & Correction: View or edit your inventory data directly within the App.

6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or under 16 where local law requires) without verified parental consent.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy for legal, technical, or operational reasons. Significant changes will be announced in-app.
